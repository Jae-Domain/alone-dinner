          <p>Gosh, walking around Takeshita street was one of the first times it actually clicked that I was in Japan. I'm a sucker for weird fashion, 
            what can I say? You wouldn't think there'd be a ton of good food in the fashion district of Tokyo...and for the most part you're right, 
            but let me clue you into some of my of my favorite hits (and misses).
            <br> <b>Hit: Potato Tornado</b> <br>
            Admittedly, this is less a Japan thing and more of an <i>any trendy city thing</i>, but I'd never seen these in the states, so i thought these were pretty cool. 
            I mean, it's like 3 feet of potato, what's not to like? Just remember that Japanese etiquette demands that you eat your food on the spot, so you better be prepared
            to down a full fried potato before moving on. (It's easier than it looks).
            <br> <b>Miss: Crepe</b> <br>
            Oooh, I know I know, I can hear the boos of disapproval already, but my unpopular opinion is that Japan doesn't do crepes very well. 
            It sounds criminal, especially because they excel in pretty much every other facet of French cooking, but I just don't think crepes are it. 
            I will add that I've exclusively had crepes from crepe stands around Tokyo, so it's possible there's some sit down place that does them pretty well, but in my experience
            they're always overpriced, understuffed, and falsely advertized. I hate to say it, but I prefer Americanized Japanese crepes. Generally underwhelming, get yourself a parfait instead.
            <br>
            <b>Hit: Age-pan</b> <br>
            Okay, this one I've seen nobody talk about, and I really don't get why. There's this little cart on Cat Street that fries these nostalgic little donuts for you. They're cheap, fresh, 
            and a great pick me up after a day of walking. (Just don't bother with the drinks. Not a good use of your money.) 
            <br> <b>Miss~: Strawberry Fetish</b> <br>
            It's Tanghulu. I'm sure it's very good tanghulu, but I'll put this as a miss just because the people I've spoken to have never been big fans of it. I also think 
            tanghulu is so easy to come by both in and out of Japan I just don't see the need to recommend this place. These Strawberry Fetish places in particular ARE everywhere so you're not missing out on much
            if you decide to skip one.  
            <br> <b>Surprising Hit: Character Cafes</b> <br>
            This one I was very surprised about, and I will acknowledge that Character Cafes exist outside of Harajuku, but this seemed as good a place as any to talk about them. 
            The character cafes are expensive, and some of them are incredibly difficult to get into. The popups though? The less crowded areas? Absolutely adorable, and well worth the markup for the novelty.
            The food is also quite good, ranging anywhere for "Oh that's not bad!" to "Wow, I actually really like this." Go in with an open mind and a slightly full wallet and I'm sure you won't be disappointed.
