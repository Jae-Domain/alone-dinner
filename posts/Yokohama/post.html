          <p>Ah Yokohama. The quieter, suburban cousin of Tokyo. Home to many a commuting student. I think if I had to pick a place to live more longterm, Yokohama would not be 
            a bad choice.
            I'd end up making a handful of journeys to Yokohama on account of some sight seeing and some collaboration with Yokohama University. 
            And I gotta say, the food is not the best part. Don't get me wrong, I'm sure there's some good stuff here it's just that my success rate with finding good eats 
            here has been pretty low. Fortunately, there is one place I can recommend whole heartedly.
          </p> 
          <b>Strawberry Season</b> <br>
          June is just past peak strawberry season in Japan (I think). So to make up for missing the mark, I opted for <i>hydroponic strawberry picking</i>.
          Greenhouse fruit picking is a pretty common thing in Japan, and it seemed just niche enough 
          to be worth a try. You'll be given this list of delightfully pantomimed strawberry etiquette before being sent off with entirely too smal baskets. 
          Strawberry picking is not economical, but the varieties and sweetness are just too good to pass up in my humble opinion.
          If picking's not your style you can always opt for a stop at the cafe for various strawberry theme desserts
          including fresh strawberry juice and <i>yet another strawberry parfait</i>.   
          <br> <br>
          <b>Instant Ramen Museum</b> <br>
          So I get that museums aren't one hundred percent food blog material, but it's a museum <i>about</i> food, that's gotta count for something.
          It was easily one of my favorite stops in Yokohama, even if I did miss out on the chance to make my own custom instant
          ramen cup :(. Something I did not miss out on, however, was the food court on the top floor. Places like this are always a solid reminder of how much 
          charm Japan  can manage to squeeze into the most unexpected of places. They've redesigned the entire floor to resemble a night market, complete with internationally 
          themed noodle dishes. The creme de la creme was anything instant ramen though, and my personal favorite was the cup noodle flavored ice cream. Yea, you heard me. 
          It had little freeze dried veggies and everything.
          Don't knock it til ya try it. It tastes pretty much how you'd expect, and I gotta say, they'd have a real market for that type of thing if they 
          went commercial. <br><br>
          <b>Chinatown</b> <br>
          Ask anyone and their mother about food from Yokohama and they'll immediately point you towards the Chinatown. 
          And the ambience is definitely worth a visit alone. The food though... Okay, so I'll preface this by saying
          I won't pretend to be some kind of Chinese food connoiseur, but it's common knowledge that Japanified cuisine
          tends to be a bit sweeter and a bit milder than their other Asian counterparts. Unluckily for me, 
          strong savory flavors are literally my absolute favorite thing about Chinese food. Needless to say...I wasn't impressed.
          But don't let that stop you, this place happens to be very popular with the Japanese public (and those sharing their taste preferences). I just can't recommend
          it personally. <br> <br>
          <b>Bonus: Yokohama University</b> <br>
          Okay, so this isn't a recommendation so much as a cute little side note. This school is adorable and I did relish the opportunity to eat in a mess hall. <br>
          The advisor was not impressed but I personally think all of the food they served hits American food out of the park. But that also might just be because I got the curry,
          you can never really go wrong with curry.
