          <p>Today's Alone Dinner suggestion was brought to you by my older brother. Now I'll be the first to admit that Italian food 
            is never my first choice for dining, but I'm happy to report that The Glass Onion has earned a spot on my list of Italian restaurants
            I'd be willing to pay money for. The Glass Onion is an unassuming North Italian restaurant tucked away in the downtown district of Weaverville, roughly 20 minutes from Asheville proper.
            They pride themselves in house made pasta, desserts, and Southern Hospitality.
          </p>

          <p>
            Since this is one of the rare instances where I will not be eating alone, I was able to sample
            far more menu items than a normal post would entail. First off! Apps for the table: waitstaff provide a single serving
            of complimentary garlic knots (which are a bit two tough for my taste), but my fellow diners were interested in trying the house truffle fries and fried calamari.
            While the fried apps were delicious (as all fried apps are) those who know me initmately will know that I have spent the past 10 years trying to track down parmesan truffle fries 
            reminiscent of my first foray with the dish, that being in some forgotten beach side shack in California. While these fries did not put an end to my search, my family adored them and I appreciated the thin cut.
          </p>

   
          <p>
            But appetizers aside, I was more interested in seeing how the pasta would turn out. The Glass Onion boasts two forms of homemade pasta, their fettucine and their gnocchi. The fettucine of which is available for substitution in any of their other pasta dishes. Given my love for fettucine, I ordered their 
            <i>Rigatoni with Braised Wild Boar Bolognese</i> and swapped out the shelf rigatoni for their house fettucine.
            My fellow diners placed a similar substitution order for the <i>Housemade Ricotta Gnocchi with Italian Sausage</i>. So essentially, we had two plates of fettucine, not that I was complaining.

            I'm a big proponent of eating pasta dishes exclusively at home, but I'm glad I made an exception for The Glass Onion. 
            The quality of their noodles is tender yet yields a deliciously soft chew, and their 
            accocmpanying sauces are subtle yet play with umami and acid undertones just enough to keep things interesting. 
            My one complaint is that I found the bolognese a bit on the thin side, but this may have also been prevented had 
            I ordered the intended rigatoni accompaniment. While I don't think my fellow diners shared my enthusiasm for this place, 
            I found it a delightful little datenight gem in an otherwise unassuming town. It's a worth a try if you're a passing by, and if so, make sure to grab one of their desserts: I've heard they're <i>divine.</i>
